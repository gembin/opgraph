Introduction

  The OpGraph project provides a framework for building complex operations from
  simpler ones. Written in Java, the framework includes:

    *  a graph data structure for constructing operations,

    *  a processing context for fine control over execution,

    *  a context structure for controlling the data flow in the graph,
  
    *  an application api for creating a custom editor to create and edit graphs, and

    *  XML persistence.
